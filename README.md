# Online Attendance With Face Recognition Using AI


Face recognition is among the most productive image processing applications and has a pivotal role in the technical field.
Recognition of the human face is an active issue for authentication purposes specifically in the context of attendance of students. 
Attendance system using face recognition is a procedure of recognizing students by using face biostatistics based on the high definition monitoring and other computer technologies.
The development of this system is aimed to accomplish digitization of the traditional system of taking attendance by calling names and maintaining pen-paper records.
Present strategies for taking attendance are tedious and time-consuming.
Attendance records can be easily manipulated by manual recording.
The traditional process of making attendance and present biometric systems is vulnerable to proxies. 
This project is therefore proposed to tackle all these problems.
